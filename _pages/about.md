I work as an educator and researcher in bioinformatics. [Bioinfopedia](https://bioinfopedia.wordpress.com/) is the name of my blog. My areas of expertise include computational drug discovery, epigenomics, AI/ML in healthcare, and computational cancer genomics.

For analysis and visualization, I use shell scripting, R, and Python. I have worked in the fields of computational genomics, NGS data analysis, single cell data analysis, structural bioinformatics, and CADD for more than eight years.
